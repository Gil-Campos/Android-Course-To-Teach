# Kotlin Fundamentals

If you have following the course you have already learn how to build your first simple android application but that is not enough,
you need to learn about the programming language used to build those apps in more depth.

Kotlin is the new industry standard that Google recommends to build Android Apps... Kotlin is the son of the ancient and very feared Java programming language but don't worry Kotlin is easier and the concepts to learn are more easy to digest so if you practice and  try to be constant on learning and building good foundations the app development (android) is going to get really easy in no time.
